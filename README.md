# 👋 Hi, I’m SjaanTheITGuy

☕ Coffee-dependent sysadmin | 💻 Full-time cable untangler | 🔧 Part-time bug creator, full-time bug fixer

### About Me  
I’m Sjaan, also known as **“that one IT person”** who knows exactly which cable to unplug (and then regret it instantly).  
- 👨‍💻 I work with servers, networks, and the occasional *mystical error 404*.  
- 🖥️ I speak fluent Bash, broken Python, and passive-aggressive error messages.  
- ☕ Fun fact: 90% of my troubleshooting is solved with *“have you tried turning it off and on again?”*  

---

### Currently  
- 🔭 Maintaining servers (or at least pretending to).  
- 🌱 Learning how to drink less coffee (failing).  
- ⚡ Random superpower: spotting a missing semicolon from 5 meters away.

### Tech Stack  
```

💾 Linux | 🐍 Python | 🐳 Docker | ☁️ Cloud (sometimes stormy)
🔌 Networking | 🔐 Security | 🤖 Automation (when it works)

```
