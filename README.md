☕ Meet Sjaan — The IT Guy You Didn’t Know You Needed (But Definitely Do)

Ever wonder who keeps the servers humming, the cables from unionizing, and the network from spontaneously combusting at 3 a.m.? Meet **SjaanTheITGuy** — coffee-powered sysadmin, part-time chaos coordinator, and full-time fixer of “weird issues that never happened before.”

Sjaan doesn’t just manage infrastructure — he *tames* it. He speaks in fluent Bash, negotiates with routers like a diplomat, and can sense a missing semicolon the way sharks smell blood.

When something breaks (and it always does), Sjaan appears out of thin air — usually holding a mug, muttering something about Docker demons, and asking if you’ve tried turning it off and on again.

Outside of work, he enjoys pretending to reduce his caffeine intake, rearranging cables for aesthetic purposes, and discovering new ways to crash Python scripts “for science.”

**Favorite quote:**

> “If it works on my machine, it’s your problem now.” – Sjaan, moments before deployment.

Oh, and here is a picture of me, I will be in your head from now on!
